# **Integrated Notes on Public Sphere and *Philosophy of Fiction* (2025-07-04)**

**Purpose**: To synthesize the July 4 Trevari discussion transcript \+ briefing notes \+ connections to *Philosophy of Fiction* to reconstruct the crisis of the public sphere ↔ technological/ethical countermeasures ↔ reality/fiction debate in one view. Uncertain or personal opinion sections are explicitly marked as **\[Uncertain\]**.

---

## **1\. Overview**

| Axis | Key Question | Summary of Issues |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Fact Layer** | “Does reality (truth) exist and is it verifiable?” | • Metaphysical realism vs. social fiction • Blockchain/AI fact verification infra ↔ fragmentation risks |
| **Value Layer** | “Can communicative rationality be maintained amid fragmentation and blocking?” | • Blocking \= democracy forfeiture? ↔ healthy boundary? • Trust in rational potential vs. strategic speech reality |
| **Tech Layer** | “Will Web3/AI save the public sphere, or is it an illusion?” | • Optimism: contribution-based PoW tokens vs. skepticism: instrumental rationality limitations |

---

## **2\. Core Terms and Frameworks**

* **Language ≠ Knowledge**: Separation between expression and ontology (knowledge graphs).

* **Definition of AGI**: Emotional capacity ↔ cross-domain adaptability.

* **Metaphysical Realism**: Presumes the existence of objective truth.

* **Fiction**: Joint human imaginings like money, nation-states, etc.

---

## **3\. Thematic Flow Summary**

### **3‑1 Language vs Knowledge Debate**

* Peter Thiel anecdote → distinction between ambiguous language and structured knowledge.

* Many doubted whether LLMs can resolve **personal ontology conflicts**.

### **3‑2 AGI Definitions and Learning Paradigms**

* **Objective function learning** (machines) vs **natural emergent learning** (organisms).

* Concern over acceleration of “intelligence reproduction” → GPT-5 / “Descendant principle” worries.

### **3‑3 Need for Ontological Mediation**

* When ontology conflicts arise, a **meta-mediator** is necessary.

* LLM \+ knowledge graph experiments: reduce ambiguity, but increase user discomfort.

## **4\. Diagnosing the ‘Half-formed Public Sphere’**

| Topic | Remarks / Evidence | Key Message |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **① Colonization of Lifeworld / Algorithmic Inequality** | Platform capitalism and recommendation algorithms promote **emotional division** (Kang Young-in, Song Sang-hyuk) | Equal speaking rights, but **distorted listening/deliberation**. |
| **② Collapse of Gatekeepers \= New Costs** | Individuals bear the cost of verifying truth (Im Jin-ho) | Risk of decline into **show-consumption spaces**. |
| **③ Citizens Reduced to Digital Consumers** | Info consumption → weaker political judgment | Public sphere turns into a **commercial noise market**. |
| **④ Cultural / Institutional Skepticism** | “German-style models need localization” | Task of redesigning a **universal public sphere**. |

## **5\. Web3 and Blockchain — Solution or Illusion?**

| Viewpoint | Detailed Arguments / Examples | Key Controversies / Counterarguments |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A. Tech Optimism (Kim Jung-joon, Cho Joon-beom)** | ① **PoW → Contribution** model (Kim): Replace influence based on “amount of speech (views)” with **contribution-based tokens** to rebalance speech rights. ② **Blockchain/AI verification layer** (Kim): Record scientific evidence on-chain to automatically filter errors overlooked by legacy media (e.g., father’s “mineral water” incident). ③ **Trust infrastructure** (Cho): Prove authenticity of speech and identity **without irresponsible intermediaries**, aiming for more **transparency and immutability**. | • **Fact/value dual layer**: “Let tech handle facts, and humans deliberate on values.” • High-res **on-chain simulators** (roads, currency, RWA, etc.) enable precise normative debate. |
| **B. Criticism / Skepticism (Minjung, Kang Kyung-won, others)** | ① **KPI replacement criticism**: Changing “amount of speech” to “contribution” is still another form of instrumental rationality. ② **Normative / validity limits**: Blockchain can verify authenticity, not **validity or normative soundness** of speech (“Dokdo belongs to Japan?” example). ③ **Confirmation bias risk**: Tech might amplify biases, turning Web3 utopia into an illusion. | “Even if scientific evidence is on-chain, what happens if majority consensus overrides science?” — concern that true/false cannot settle social/political disputes. |
| **C. Kim Jung-joon’s Rebuttal** | • **Admits instrumentalism \+ asserts necessity**: “PoW is a KPI. But without a **basic infrastructure for scientific evidence**, discourse itself is distorted.” • **Sharp drop in verification costs**: Blockchain/AI replace legacy media's fact-checking in a **decentralized, low-cost** way. • **Contribution-based speech priority**: Suggests natural leadership for **fact contributors** (e.g., lead paper authors, OpenAI researchers). | “Technology cannot replace **communicative rationality**, but is essential as **infrastructure to reduce information distortion**.” |
| **D. Partial Consensus and Remaining Issues** | **Common Ground**: ① Blockchain is just **trust infrastructure** — it must be paired with **communicative ethics**. ② **Stable fact layer → possible value debate**. **Open Issues**: • Will “contribution tokens” create **new inequalities**? • Real-world viability of **on-chain simulations**? |  |

## **6\. Blocking and Fragmentation — Communicative Rationality and Democracy**

| Sub-Axis | Points & Examples (Transcript 2:28:50 – 2:49:44) | Key Messages / Potential Pitfalls (Verification Points) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **① Control Tower Dilemma** | • “Plural fragmentation without central control may be **safer**.” • *Kim*: “Loss of objectivity/commonality → risk of \*\*‘free-for-all’.” • *Moderator*: “Embed ‘truth-checking obligation’ in platform constitutions.” | ▶ Balance between over-pluralism and collapse of shared reality. ▶ \[Uncertain\]: No data showing that ‘loss of objectivity’ leads to democratic collapse. |
| **② Politics & Ethics of Blocking** | • *Moderator*: “Blocking \= end of dialogue → **abandoning democracy**.” • Many shared examples from family, SNS, North Korea. • Blocking may be a **mental health safeguard**. | ▶ Is blocking \= communication shutdown or boundary setting? ▶ Data lacking on correlation between blocking frequency and democratic participation. |
| **③ Distinguishing Personal vs Structural Violence** | • “Destructive relationships like violence/gambling justify blocking.” • “Is simple miscommunication in equal relationships enough reason to block?” • Need legal/ethical harm criteria. | ▶ Agreed need to separate **ethical/legal harm** from **mere disagreement**. ▶ Institutionalize blocking via **‘minimum harm test’**. |
| **④ Feasibility of Communicative Rationality** | • Quoting Habermas: “All humans have **rational potential** → must remain open till the end.” • “Autonomous democracy within separate communities is also possible.” • Extreme case: North Korea blocking. | ▶ Tradeoff between open dialogue vs autonomous group formation (fragmentation). ▶ \[Uncertain\]: Empirical evidence lacking for ‘rational potential’. |
| **⑤ Retry after Blocking — “Nth Communication” Model** | • Examples: VC funding, teen-parent dynamics, AI comments → “cooling down → reconnection strategy.” • Parents unblocked political channels after temporary block. | ▶ Need to design re-entry paths, not just permanent cutoffs. ▶ Data needed: success rate and psychological cost of re-engagement. |
| **⑥ After Fragmentation: Mutual Understanding Required** | • “After dismantling the mainstream, each fragment must strive for **self-reflection \+ mutual understanding**.” • *Moderator*: Need to escape **‘avatar society’ of self-monologues**. | ▶ Public sphere crisis is due more to **lack of dialogue between fragments** than fragmentation itself. ▶ Algorithmic recommendation ↔ need for mutual understanding platforms. |
| **⑦ Structural Effects of Block/Algorithm Filtering** | • Increased use of AI comment filters. • “YouTube/Twitter algorithms spread extreme views.” | ▶ **Platform design (algorithmic blocking)** is key to shaping the public sphere. ▶ \[Uncertain\]: Long-term studies lacking on how algorithm adjustment affects blocking rates. |

**Intermediate Conclusion (Extended)**

1. **Blocking can be allowed as a safeguard**, but platforms/policy must design **retry pathways (Quarantine → Re-engage)**.

2. A cyclical structure is needed: **Stable Fact Layer (via blockchain/AI) → Contribution-based speech redistribution → Minimized blocking/reengagement**.

3. Communicative rationality **cannot be ensured through tech/institutions alone** — it must be accompanied by ethical learning and self-reflection by citizens.

## **7\. *Philosophy of Fiction* Linkage — Fiction, Reality, and the Obligation to Verify Truth**

| Sub-Axis | Discussion Points / Examples | Key Messages / Controversies / Verification Points |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **① Selection Background & Awareness** | • Book selected to revisit *Philosophy of Fiction*'s **public sphere ↔ fiction** framing (Moderator). • Remaining questions from previous sessions partially addressed. | ▶ The two books offer **complementary frameworks**. |
| **② Metaphysical Realism vs Social Fiction** | • “Truth (reality) exists. Money, nations, companies are **human fictions**.” • Cites Yuval Harari’s *Sapiens* fiction order. | ▶ **Objective reality \+ fictional order** dual structure. ▶ \[Uncertain\]: No philosophical consensus on the definition of “reality.” |
| **③ Fiction Visualization Experiment** | Car, wing, Web3 drawings compared → “Mental concepts ≠ physical objects.” • Prompt to “draw Web3” results only in abstract icons. | ▶ Visualization makes **fiction vs reality** distinctions more intuitive. |
| **④ Fiction’s Social Function & Risk** | • 1-week chat with an **Instagram scam account**: “Lonely people believe fictions.” • Fiction offers **social cohesion** but is also a **tool for manipulation/fraud**. | ▶ Fiction \+ emotional lack → erosion of reality. ▶ Verification needed: no data shown for “loneliness → belief in fiction” correlation. |
| **⑤ Constitutionalization of Truth Verification** | • “Media/platforms must carry **constitutional-level obligation** to verify truth.” • Connects to Web3 verification layer. | ▶ Emphasizes the need for **fact verification infrastructure**. ▶ Implementation: blockchain notarization \+ AI fact-checking. |
| **⑥ Concerns Over Fragmentation and Collapse of Objectivity** | • *Kim Jung-joon*: “Excessive pluralism → risk of ‘world without objectivity’.” | ▶ Task: Balance between fragmentation and sustaining shared reality. |
| **⑦ Ontology & Knowledge Graphs** | • Revisits Language vs Knowledge: use of knowledge graphs to **structure true/false**. • LLM \+ KG experiment discussed. | ▶ Attempt to **technologically verify fiction**. ▶ \[Uncertain\]: Scalable application of knowledge graphs not yet verified. |
| **⑧ Simulation / Sapiens Debate** | • “Is our world a simulation?” re-examined. • “All concepts are fiction” → boosts importance of **verifying facts** in the public sphere. | ▶ As reality/fiction blur, **verification mechanisms become essential**. |
| **⑨ Meta-Consensus (Two-Layer Design)** | • Need for **stable truth layer** first, followed by **fiction layer** deliberation. • Must design **dual structure**: verification ↔ communicative ethics. | ▶ Blockchain/AI \= lower verification, Human deliberation \= upper interpretation. ▶ Task: define **interface between the two layers**. |
| **⑩ Remaining Uncertainties & Verification Gaps** | • Lacks external data for Instagram scam/simulation arguments. • No academic consensus on **metaphysical realism vs constructivism**. | ▶ Requires further research: sociopsychological and anthropological data. |

**Integrated Context (Update)**  
 The discussions in *Sections 6–7* on **fact verification infrastructure · blocking/fragmentation · communicative ethics** align with the dual structure issue raised by *Philosophy of Fiction*. The shared insight: **Only after stabilizing the Truth Layer can meaningful public deliberation occur in the Fiction Layer**.
