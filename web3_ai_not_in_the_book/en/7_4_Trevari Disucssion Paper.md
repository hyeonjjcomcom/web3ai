### Summary of Jin-Ho Lim's Logical Structure in *"Freedom Comes at a High Cost"*

1. **Historical Premise**\
   In the past, the public sphere was moderated by gatekeepers such as media outlets and broadcasters who filtered and refined information before it reached the public.

2. **Diagnosis of the Present**\
   With the evolution of media, the role of gatekeepers has disappeared. Now, anyone can become an information producer, which liberates individuals from minority control but ushers in an era of distrust where no information is easily trusted.

3. **Emergence of a New Cost**\
   Consequently, individuals now bear the full responsibility of discerning the authenticity of information. Every citizen must develop sufficient literacy and invest time and effort to judge information—this is the new "cost."

4. **Conclusion and Task**\
   Therefore, freedom in the modern public sphere is not free. The "freedom" to produce information demands a high "cost" of critical thinking and verification. Our task is to recognize and willingly pay this new cost of freedom.

### Summary of Yeon-Woo Lee's Logical Structure in *"The Evolution of the Public Sphere and the Redefinition of Democracy"*

1. **Historical Premise**\
   The modern public sphere, once a mediating space between civil society and political systems, began to lose autonomy and weaken in late modernity.

2. **Diagnosis of the Present**\
   The spread of digital media, commercialization of politics, and civic fragmentation have severely degraded the "quality of deliberation." Rational discourse has vanished, leaving only shifting public opinion—this is what Habermas calls a "structural transformation of the public sphere."

3. **Possibility of Transition**\
   Habermas offers "deliberative democracy" as a solution—one that goes beyond mere voting to ensure political legitimacy through active participation and rational debate. Even in pessimism, he believes in the resilience of human reason.

4. **Conclusion and Task**\
   Thus, this book is a call for reason to those concerned about democracy. We must restore public discourse rather than remain silent amid an information flood, practicing the communal ethics of "courage to speak" and "responsibility to listen."

### Summary of Min-Jung's Logical Structure in Her Book Review

1. **Fundamental Dilemma**\
   Modern democracy faces a core dilemma between individual freedom (democracy) and norms (rule of law). To overcome it, "deliberative politics," grounded in citizen consensus rather than monarchy or religion, is necessary.

2. **Diagnosis of the Present**\
   Decentralized technologies like Web3 are presented as ideal tools for deliberative politics, but this is an illusion. Fundamental flaws of the digital environment—fake news, division, and anonymity-based irresponsibility—worsen democracy's crisis.

3. **Recognition of Fundamental Limitations**\
   Expecting mature civic awareness and culture in place of technological solutions is also unrealistic. Humans are fundamentally selfish, and without legal constraints, forming an autonomous culture is implausible.

4. **Conclusion and Task**\
   Therefore, the utopia of Web3 for all will never come. Technology will become a political tool for a few, deepening class divides and triggering new crises. Our task is to recognize the danger of such technological idealism.

### Summary of Kyung-Won Kang's Logical Structure in *"Resonance of Questions Amid Complexity"*

1. **Critique of Fundamental Premise**\
   Habermas’s ideal public sphere assumes a "perfectly rational individual," akin to the unrealistic assumptions of classical economics, ignoring human irrationality and becoming a fundamental theoretical limitation.

2. **Diagnosis of the Present**\
   These limitations become more complex with emerging technologies like Web3. Though a seeming alternative to centralized Web2, Web3 exposes its own issues—filter bubbles, technical barriers, and capital influence—showing technology alone can't realize an ideal public sphere.

3. **Reaffirmation of Essential Conditions**\
   Regardless of platform, the success of a public sphere hinges not on technology but on participants’ "ethical responsibility in communication." The fundamental issue returns to human qualifications.

4. **Conclusion and Task**\
   Therefore, Habermas’s ideal should not be a realizable blueprint but a "normative orientation"—valued for the important questions it raises, like in *Waiting for Godot.* Our task is to strive toward this impossible ideal to prevent democratic regression.

### Summary of Se-Jung Na's Logical Structure in *"Public Sphere"*

1. **Historical Premise**\
   The public sphere evolved from a physical space to a global network dissolving time-space boundaries. Theoretically, this digital sphere is highly interactive and ideal, where everyone is an author.

2. **Diagnosis of the Present**\
   However, reality deviates from this ideal. The boundary between public and private is blurred, fake news is rampant, and commercial logic has eroded trust in communicative spaces.

3. **Recognition of Limits and Transfer of Responsibility**\
   Improving this new media public sphere starts not with technology but with clear recognition of its limitations. Responsibility for resolution shifts from systems to individual participants.

4. **Conclusion and Task**\
   Hence, the task of turning the public sphere into a space for mature deliberation falls to each of us. As citizens, we must embody "public responsibility," guard against cognitive biases, and strive for understanding and acceptance of differences.

### Summary of Do-Ha Choi's Logical Structure in *"Half-Public Sphere"*

1. **Historical Premise**\
   The ideal of a public sphere—where equals engage in rational discourse—has shifted online to spaces like social media and the metaverse during the COVID era.

2. **Diagnosis of the Present**\
   Yet online spaces grant voice to all, while influence is unequally distributed via algorithms favoring "likes" and "views." This results in paradoxes: abundant speech but no listeners, technological connection but deliberative isolation.

3. **Raising Fundamental Questions**\
   These realities prompt difficult questions—platform neutrality, fake news, and responsibility—showing the complexity of ethical communication.

4. **Conclusion and Task**\
   Even if Habermas’s ideal public sphere seems unrealistic, we must not abandon it. Doing so risks turning into avatars who only talk to themselves. Our task is to treat this impossible ideal as a guiding light.

### Summary of Jung-Jun Kim's Logical Structure in *"Incentivizing the Open Web of the Public Sphere"*

1. **Historical Premise**\
   The public sphere has expanded beyond physical limits into the web, where boundaries blur between human cognitive limits and machine productivity.

2. **Diagnosis of the Present**\
   Today’s online public sphere measures influence by the "amount of speech," a distorted metric unconnected to productivity. Sometimes machines (like AIs) outperform humans who merely talk more.

3. **Possibility of Transition**\
   A solution is to apply Web3’s "Proof of Work"—not valuing speech quantity but measuring real-world contributions and reshaping the public sphere accordingly.

4. **Conclusion and Task**\
   A contribution-based sphere allows productive human-machine harmony. South Korea, with high internet literacy, can lead this future. Our task is to become impactful contributors on platforms like Twitter or TikTok.

### Summary of Junbum Cho's Logical Structure in His Book Review

1. **Historical Premise**\
   Democracy's legitimacy is rooted in citizen participation. However, the collapse of boundaries between public and private due to digitalization triggered a fundamental crisis.

2. **Diagnosis of the Present**\
   As a result, the "half-public sphere" has spread. Habermas's solution—"deliberative politics"—seems unrealistic. Social media weakens critical thinking, and individuals cannot resist the overwhelming flow merging virtual and real worlds.

3. **Possibility of Transition**\
   Yet Web3 technology offers new possibilities. Against the problem of irresponsible intermediaries distorting information, blockchain’s transparency and immutability provide a trust-based technical solution.

4. **Conclusion and Task**\
   The core task is to explore whether Web3 will further disrupt or restore the public sphere. This involves tackling trust collapse, content chaos, and rebuilding a new sphere via trustworthy technology.

## \<Virtual Roundtable Discussion: Is a New Public Sphere Possible?>

**Topic**: Crisis and New Possibilities of the Public Sphere in the Digital Age\
**Participants (12)**: Yoon-Kyung Hwang, Sang-Hyuk Song, Ye-Ji Kim, Young-In Kang, Jin-Ho Lim, Yeon-Woo Lee, Min-Jung, Kyung-Won Kang, Se-Jung Na, Do-Ha Choi, Jung-Jun Kim, Junbum Cho

**Moderator**: Welcome, and thank you all for participating in today’s roundtable, "Is a New Public Sphere Possible?" Based on Habermas’s theories, we have explored both the crises and possibilities facing today’s digital public sphere. Let’s start by diagnosing the nature of the crisis. Young-In Kang, what do you see as the biggest problem?

**Young-In Kang**: The public sphere was originally a space for rational discussion, but not anymore. With platform capitalism infiltrating daily life, the public sphere has become a place of emotional division, dominated by hate and agitation. It's now a fragmented, closed space that no longer represents society as a whole, weakening the foundation of deliberative democracy.

**Sang-Hyuk Song**: (Nods) I strongly agree. That fragmented sphere is what I see every day in my job. In the economy of attention—driven by views and likes—content spreads rapidly but meaningful deliberation vanishes. There’s excitement in amplifying brand messages, but also anxiety as public dialogue grows shallow.

**Jin-Ho Lim**: Both of you are right. Responsibility has shifted to the individual. In the past, gatekeepers like news organizations filtered content. Now that role is gone. While anyone can now be an author, this also means we live in a time where no one’s information is fully trustworthy. Individuals now pay the high cost of literacy and effort to judge truth.

**Moderator**: Summarizing your points, the public sphere has become commercialized and divided, with individuals burdened by the task of discerning truth. Is there a way out? Ye-Ji Kim, do you see any possibilities?

**Ye-Ji Kim**: I think blaming media technology alone is premature. Even in the past, irrational public opinions like witch hunts existed. What matters is how the system is designed. Take the Shin-Gori nuclear public debate as an example. Despite initial opposition, a well-designed system of information and deliberation led citizens to rational conclusions. Proper system design can make media a supplement to representative democracy.

**Jung-Jun Kim**: (Building on her point) That’s right. System design is critical. I suggest borrowing Web3’s "Proof of Work." Right now, influence is based on "how much one talks"—a flawed metric. Let’s shift that to actual contributions to the real world. With such systems, we can create a public sphere where productive humans and machines coexist.

**Junbum Cho**: I also see potential in Web3. If the crisis Habermas identified was caused by "irresponsible intermediaries," blockchain’s transparency and immutability offer a trust-based technical solution. Our core challenge is whether Web3 can rebuild a healthier public sphere.

**Moderator**: These are optimistic takes on technology and systems. But surely not everyone agrees. Min-Jung, your thoughts?

**Min-Jung**: (Firmly) I think it's all an illusion. A Web3 utopia? It’ll never happen. The digital environment has fundamental flaws: falsehoods, division, and irresponsibility. The bigger problem isn’t tech—it’s human nature. Humans are fundamentally selfish and evil. Without legal constraints, expecting 7 billion people to develop mature civic awareness is unrealistic. Technology will only become a political tool for a few, deepening inequality.

**Kyung-Won Kang**: I want to add a philosophical point. Habermas’s theory presumes a "fully rational individual," like classical economics. But humans are irrational. The same applies to Web3. No matter how advanced tech becomes, human cognitive bias and irrationality won’t disappear. Success depends on ethical communication, not tech.

**Moderator**: Strong counterarguments. You've identified fundamental limits in human nature and irrationality. Where do we go from here? Yeon-Woo Lee, can you offer a direction?

**Yeon-Woo Lee**: I think we must focus on the "process." Habermas’s deliberative democracy isn’t a finished institution but a journey of legitimacy built through citizen participation and rational debate. This book doesn’t give answers, but asks what political culture we should aim for. The first step is ethical practice: the courage to speak and the responsibility to listen.

**Se-Jung Na**: I agree. Responsibility now falls on individuals. We must recognize the limits of the new media public sphere, embody "appropriate public responsibility," guard against personal biases, and consciously strive to embrace difference.

**Do-Ha Choi**: Exactly. Even if Habermas’s ideal seems impossible, we must not abandon it. If we do, we become avatars speaking only to ourselves. That unreachable ideal must remain our guide.

**Moderator**: So in the end, beyond systems and technologies, it comes down to individual ethics, responsibility, and striving toward ideals. To close, I’d like Yoon-Kyung Hwang to share a final thought.

**Yoon-Kyung Hwang**: Hearing everyone’s views, I find renewed hope. The 21st century is clearly a time of chaos induced by technology. But historically, chaos has always led to new order. What matters now is that efforts for stabilization—like AI regulation—are starting. This moment is a turning point that will determine whether a new public sphere can be born. Its success depends not just on systems and technologies, but also on our growth and sincere reflection. The ideal public sphere is not a finished product—it is the very process itself.

**Moderator**: Thank you. With that final note on "the public sphere as a process" and the importance of our participation, we conclude today’s discussion. Thank you all.

## \<Habermas's Commentary on the Discussion>

**Habermas**: Ladies and gentlemen, I followed your passionate discussion with great interest. I am deeply impressed that each of you have seriously grappled with the issues of the "public sphere" and "communicative rationality" I have explored for decades. Your discourse identifies the core crisis of democracy today, and also highlights the essence and limits of my theory. I would like to add a few key reflections.

1. **Accurate Diagnosis of Crisis: The Colonization of the Lifeworld**\
   I fully agree with the diagnoses of Young-In Kang and Sang-Hyuk Song. The "emotionally fragmented sphere" and the "attention economy" you described are modern manifestations of what I warned about—the colonization of the lifeworld by the system. The instrumental logic of money (platform capitalism) and power (algorithms) has eroded the communicative fabric of the lifeworld.

   Jin-Ho Lim’s point about the disappearance of gatekeepers and the transfer of responsibility to individuals is equally important. The literary and political critique roles of the bourgeois public sphere have faded. Now, individuals must sift through unfiltered information to find truth—a burdensome task. This resembles the refeudalization of the public sphere, where critical publics disappear and passive audiences react to curated shows by giant platforms.

2. **Limitations of Technological Solutions: Communicative Rationality Cannot Be Replaced**\
   The most fascinating yet concerning part of your discussion was the focus on Web3. While creative, suggestions like Jung-Jun Kim’s Proof of Work replace one instrumental rationality (speech quantity) with another (contribution measure). But the public sphere is not about efficiency—it is about mutual understanding through argument. Likewise, blockchain might prove authenticity or identity, but not validity, sincerity, or moral rightness. Technical trust cannot substitute social trust and may obscure the real issues.

3. **Beyond Cynicism about Human Nature**\
   This brings us to Min-Jung’s skepticism. Her view that humans are evil and selfish recalls the pessimism of my mentors Adorno and Horkheimer. Of course, humans are not always rational. As Kyung-Won Kang notes, I do not assume perfect rationality.

   But language and communicative acts inherently aim toward mutual understanding. When we argue, we implicitly claim our statement is true, sincere, and right—and expect others to respond with reason. Abandoning this potential is to abandon democracy itself. My theory is not based on naive faith in human nature, but in the rational potential of language.

4. **The Right Path: Procedure, Ethics, and Normative Orientation**\
   In conclusion, your discussion is heading in the right direction. The Shin-Gori (신고리) deliberative committee case, cited by Ye-Ji Kim, is a brilliant example of how institutions can enable deliberation—exactly what I mean by institutionalizing deliberative democracy.

   Moreover, the views of Yeon-Woo Lee, Se-Jung Na, and Do-Ha Choi perfectly grasp the core of my theory: the recovery of the public sphere depends on civic virtues—the courage to speak and the responsibility to listen. This is the practice of communicative ethics.
